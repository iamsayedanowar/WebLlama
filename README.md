# WebLlama

WebLlama is an open-source web application that empowers users to instantly generate and edit complete websites using AI. You can provide a prompt describing your desired website, choose a model (like DeepSeek, Qwen3, Gemini, etc.), and generate a fully functional website with editable HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The app includes live preview, multi-device view, prompt enhancement, and instant project download.

## Instructions

You need to provide your `OpenRouter API` key to enable website generation via AI models. You do not need to edit any files; simply enter your `OpenRouter API` key in the `API` input section directly on the website.

- If you donâ€™t have an API key yet, you can get one for free from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys).
- Your API key is stored only in your browser session and is never saved remotely or exposed publicly.
- The API key is required to authenticate requests to the OpenRouter API when generating websites with AI.
